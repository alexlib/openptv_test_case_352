# openptv_test_case_352
This is my personal attempt to test OpenPTV software performance on the case 352 from the www.piv.jp

Working folder for test case #352 from the www.piv.jp analysed long time ago on a 3D-PTV software (C/Tcl-Tk version) by Alex Liberzon. The synthetic data belongs to the authors of the Synthetic PIV project.
